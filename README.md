# Project: Analyzing MercadoLibre's Financial and User Data

## Background
You are a growth analyst at MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. Your goal is to analyze the company's financial and user data in order to identify opportunities for growth. Specifically, you want to investigate whether the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

## What You're Creating
To drive revenue, you will create a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. Your notebook should include visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company, an evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic, and a Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic. You will also answer a set of questions provided in the instructions.

## Instructions
To get started, configure a Google Colaboratory workspace and upload the starter notebook. Then, follow the instructions provided in four main steps:

Find unusual patterns in hourly Google Search traffic.
Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.
Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.
Create a time series model using Prophet.
Optionally, you can also forecast the company's future revenue using time series models.

## Workspace Setup
To begin the project, follow these steps:

Open Google Colab and upload the starter notebook.
Run the code in the "Install and import the required libraries and dependencies" section, which installs and imports necessary libraries for the notebook.
